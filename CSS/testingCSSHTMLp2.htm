<p style="border:2px solid black; background-color:lightgray;">Using external CSS I have placed a link in the "head" tag that links to a file with the specifig formatting I want for this (and any other pages linked to the file. the file is csstest.css. it could be names anything but must have the extension of .css. in this case the formatting specified "color-background" would be "orange", "h1" would be "darkgreen", and "p" would be purple"</p>
<h1>This is a linked Page using External CSS</H1>
<br>
<p>If I did this right this will be a linked page</p>
<br>
<p>and this link should take you back to the <a href="file:///C:/Users/jason/OneDrive/HTML_Test/css/testingcssHTML.htm">CSS page</a>.</p>
