<Title>Jason's Bored Quarentine Project CSS Section</title>
</head>

<p style="border:2px solid black; background-color:lightgray;">In the Header tag I used <strong>internal CSS</strong> to change all "p" tags to "blue" (Including the text in these boxes) all "h1" tags to "darkgrey", and the "background-color" to Powder Blue.</p>

<p style="border:2px solid black; background-color:lightgray;">Edits from main page will be marked in a box like this one.<br>The background from the header was switched from "red" to "orange", the Text color was switched to "darkgrey" and the font was increased in size to 75px and "jokerman" fonte unless otherwards specified.<br>The text in the second line was changed from "red" to "darkgreen".<br> These are both examples of <strong> Inline CSS </strong>and can be added into any tag that includes readable text.</p>
<!--note the input needed for multiple styles in the above two lines-->

<p>If I cared enough to type a paragraph I would type it here</p>
<p >This is my second paragraph just to see how they interact with each other</p>
<br>
<p> I am now going to try to get a <a href="file:///C:/Users/jason/OneDrive/HTML_Test/css/testingCSSHTMLp2.htm">page link</a>.</p>
<p style="border:2px solid black; background-color:lightgray;">I am using the above link to test <strong>External CSS</strong> this is done by putting a link to a specific file in the "head" tag.</p>
<br>
<p> and now for fun with pictures... today I feel like this <img src="file:///C:/Users/jason/OneDrive/HTML_Test/media/Red_Lantern_Corps_004.jpg"></p>
<p> and to shrink it down with a conflicting width or height<img src="file:///C:/Users/jason/OneDrive/HTML_Test/media/Red_Lantern_Corps_004.jpg" width="275" height="175"></p>
<p> and to shrink it down with width or Height (this example) only<img src="file:///C:/Users/jason/OneDrive/HTML_Test/media/Red_Lantern_Corps_004.jpg" height="175"></p>
<!--The ratio in a picture will be maintaned if only 1 width or height is used-->
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="file:///C:/Users/jason/OneDrive/HTML_Test/media/black lantern logo.jpg"height="97px"><img src="file:///C:/Users/jason/OneDrive/HTML_Test/media/Indigo tribe logo.jpg" height="97px"><img src="file:///C:/Users/jason/OneDrive/HTML_Test/media/orange lantern logo.jpg" height="97px"><img src="file:///C:/Users/jason/OneDrive/HTML_Test/media/sinestro corps logo.jpg" height="97px"><img src="file:///C:/Users/jason/OneDrive/HTML_Test/media/green lantern logo.jpg" height="97px"><img src="file:///C:/Users/jason/OneDrive/HTML_Test/media/Blue Lantern logo.jpg" height="97px"><img src="file:///C:/Users/jason/OneDrive/HTML_Test/media/red Lantern logo.jpg" height="97px"><img src="file:///C:/Users/jason/OneDrive/HTML_Test/media/star saphire logo.jpg" height="97px"><img src="file:///C:/Users/jason/OneDrive/HTML_Test/media/white lantern logo.jpg" height="97px"></p>

<p>I am going to use an alt attribute here it will be linked to the image above but the link will be incorrectly entered. <img src="file:///C:/Users/jason/OneDrive/HTML_Test/media/typo_Lantern_Corps_004.jpg" alt="Red Lanterns image"></p>
<p> so now to add color to everything.</p>
<p style="color:red;"> this is a red paragraph. </p>
<p> this is a <text style="color:red;"> RED </text> word </p> <!--I figured out how to do just one word myself-->
<br>
<h3>title toolips</h3>
<p title="thanks for mousing over me">mouse over me. </p>
<p> <text title="Mouse over me">mouse over me</text> <text title="I said don't mouse over me">not over me</text> </p>
<p title="use single quotes (') in plasce of double quotes"> how do you use double quotes if the text has double quotes? </p>
<hr>
<p>the horizontal board above and below this line are calle horizontal rules and are put in with the &#60;hr&#62; tag</p>
<hr>

<pre>
this
is
done
using the 
pre
tag
and
not 
the br
tag
everything in between the pre and /pre tags is formatted on the screen the same as in the code including enters and spaces.
this could be usefull for longer paragraphs or log enteries. however it will not automatically adjust the width to fit within a screen.

<h2>Quotations and Citations</h2>
<hr>
<p>There are a few different ways to use quotations and sitations they are as follows:</p>
<p>Blockquote tag. this is used to quote a longer quote from another source. you can also add a cite into the tag to tell where the quote is from.</p>
<p>with the block quote tag the text - To instill fear is to instill order â€“ OUR order! The Guardians had billions of years to bring oder to this universe. They failed.
Now it is OUR turn to spread our light. Our turn to take control!
We will drive fear into the hearts of those who would worship chaos. But first, we will burn those who stand in our way!</>
<p> would become <blockquote cite="https://comicbookandbeyond.com/green-lantern-quotes">To instill fear is to instill order &#045; OUR order! The Guardians had billions of years to bring oder to this universe. They failed.
Now it is OUR turn to spread our light. Our turn to take control!
We will drive fear into the hearts of those who would worship chaos. But first, we will burn those who stand in our way!</bockquote></p>
<p> It Blocks it and indents it.</blockquote></p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p> you could also add a q tag for shorter quotes.</p>
<p>And then Hal said <q>The one thing a Green Lantern is supposed to be is fearless. &#034;Fearless&#034; is the job description. That isn&#039;t me...</q></p>
when using the q tag you do not need to place the " symbol in. the tag will take care of it for you.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p> sometimes there will be need for abbriviations to help search engines and make help to make sure it does not trip up spell checkers. If combined it with the title to help readers identify the acronym.<p>
<p> with just the abbr tag it would look like this <abbr>CCH</abbr> was a great place to work. With the abbr title tag you get this. <abbr title="Camp Chief Hector">CCH</abbr> was a great place to work.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p> Another type of quote you can use is the address quote, this will help to define contact information like so </p>
<address>
Jason Peck. <br>
Apiring code monkey<br>
W3 Unlimited <br>
1234 56th street.<br>

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-peck-a0498588/">www.linkedin.com</a><br>
123-456-7890<br>
</address>
<p>the address tag also automatically italicises the text within.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>The Cite tag will allow you to define the title of a peice of work and will usually Italicise.</p>
<img src="file:///C:/Users/jason/OneDrive/HTML_Test/media/kyle_rayner_omega_lantern_by_gasa979-dc4amoi.png" width="250"<img><br>
<cite>Omega by <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/gasa979"> Gasa979</a></cite>
<p>the above cite tag also had a link tag within the tag.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override and with this tag you can do this.</p>
<bdo dir="rtl">BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override and with this tag you can do this.</bdo>
<hr>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<hr>
<p>Comments are a way to leave text in the code. it will not allow the section in the code to be seen on the page. You can also place the tag around other emement tags to keep them from displaying on the page. the tag &#060;!-- Looks like this.--&#062;</p>
<p>I'm going to include a tag for the above Omega image below this line but it will be embedded in a comment tag so it won't be seen.</p>

<h2 style="background-color:black; color:white;">The Wonderful World of <text style="color:red;">C<text style="color:orange;">O<text style="color:green;">L<text style="color:yellow;">O<text style="color:Purple;">R<text style="color:grey;">. </h2>
<hr>
<p style="color:purple;">There are a few different ways to add color into either text or the background all the tags start the same way but can end with color names, or with RGB,HEX, HSL,RGBA, or HSLA values. there are many different sites that can give you these vallues online.</p>
<p> The three different things that can be colored are:</p>
<p style="background-color:powderblue;">the Background.</p>
<p style="color:blue;">the Text.</p>
<p style="border:2px solid red;">A border surrounding the text.</p>
<p style="border:6px solid red;">fun fact the thickness of the border can also be changed.</p>
<p> Below are three examples of different values (RGB, HEX, HSL)
<h1 style="background-color:rgb(255, 180, 122);">RGB</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:#80ff00;">HEX (I like this one the best)</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(9, 83%, 100%);">HSL</h1>
<p> With a minor tweak you can add an alpha channel to the RGB aor HSL. Add "a" to the tag rgba or hsla and then add an additional value with a decimal between 0.0 nd 1.0 to the tag. the below examples are set to 525% (0.25).</p>
<h1 style="background-color:rgba(255, 180, 122, 0.25);">RGBA</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsla(9, 83%, 100%, 0.25);">HSLA</h1>

<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>The next area will cover CSS which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. for this I will link to a copy of this page where CSS has been added. I will post notes in a black box for what has been changed. I will also rename the Page and the tab information.</p>
<p><a href="file:///C:/Users/jason/OneDrive/HTML_Test/Main/testingHTML.htm">Return to main page...</a>
